### Short Description:
A short demo game about pressing your luck and trying not to get embarrassed.

### Long Description:
BRUHssian Roulette is a game revolving around the concept of funny, embarrassing situations. 
In this demo, you can test your luck in a single-player game by pressing the SOLO button on the home screen.
From here, you'll be presented with the game screen, where you can either spin the wheel or press your luck right away by pressing the READY button.
If none of the remaining slots feel safe, simply hit the RESET button to randomize the wheel and reset your odds to 1/6.
If you lose, a random image from your phone will be displayed on-screen for all to see.
So, you feeling lucky, bruh?
